# IoT Controller
Build an IoT controller using a RaspberryPi web server with Flask REST API on Nginx, Gunicorn, and Supervisor. Easily create API endpoints to install and control a local network of devices. The controller can be used with its default browser interface or any application capable of sending HTTP requests.

> NOTE: This project is still under development. The fundamental concept is complete but a few of its features are not fully implemented.

## Installations
* [Flask (Python)](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)

### Flask App Files
    /FlaskApp

These files are for the Flask API and web interface.

* HTML, CSS, and Javascript is used with Bootstrap to create a simple, mobile friendly browser interface
* Flask is used to provide the REST API
